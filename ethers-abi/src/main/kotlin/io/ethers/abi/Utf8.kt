 *
 *
 * The variant of UTF-8 implemented by this class is the restricted definition of UTF-8
 * introduced in Unicode 3.1. One implication of this is that it rejects ["non-shortest form"](http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum1.html) byte sequences,
 * even though the JDK decoder may accept them.
