# Kriptal Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the Kriptal team and community is made up of a diverse group of professionals
and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching and
connecting people.

Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, yet it can sometimes lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To
address this, we have established some essential guidelines that we expect all community members, including founders,
mentors, and those seeking assistance, to follow.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a
guide to make it easier to enrich all of us, the technical community and the conferences and usergroups we hope to guide
new speakers to.

This Code of Conduct applies to all forms of communication, including IRC, mailing lists, and other platforms like
Discord, Telegram, etc.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please report it by sending an email to report@kriptal.io.

## Our Standards

- **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
- **Be considerate.** Recognize that your work will benefit others, and you, in turn, will rely on the work of your
  colleagues. Any decisions you make have an impact on users and peers, so consider these consequences when making
  choices.
- **Be respectful.** Disagreements are natural, but they should never lead to disrespectful behavior or poor manners.
  While frustration may occasionally arise, it must never escalate into personal attacks. It's crucial to maintain a
  comfortable and productive community. Kriptal community members should treat each other and outsiders with respect.
- **Choose your words carefully.** As professionals, we are expected to conduct ourselves professionally.
- **Be kind to others.** Maintain professionalism and avoid insulting or belittling fellow participants. Harassment and
  exclusionary behavior have no place here.

Disagreements, whether technical or social, are part of life, and Kriptal is no exception. When disagreements arise, we
strive to understand each other's perspectives. It's essential to resolve differences constructively. Remember that our
strength lies in our diverse community with individuals from various backgrounds. People hold different views, and not
understanding someone's perspective doesn't make it wrong. It's human to make mistakes, so let's focus on helping one
another learn and grow.
